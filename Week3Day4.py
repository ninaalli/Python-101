Part I - What is a wrapper? (not rapper)
A wrapper function is making your code more efficient and DRY (keep it in one language) by wrapping it in a method we can invoke when we need it.
In terms of Python and APIs we want to wrap our api calls in a method so we don't have to fill our code repeating endpoints
when we built SQL and it was wrapped in the Python language - 

APIs and wrappers

API keys are used to limit who and how many requests can be made in a given time frame.

Part II - API Limitations/API Keys
API key requirement
API keys are used to limit who and how many requests can be made in a given time frame
When you get a key to an API make sure to see if there are limitations and what those limitations are

Part III - Gitignore and Environmental Variables
You can create a gitignore file and choose which files to not push to github
You can also use Environmental Variables.
