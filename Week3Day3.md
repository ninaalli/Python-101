API (application program interface) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. The API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.

To the extent that systems conform to the constraints of REST they can be called RESTful. RESTful systems typically, but not always, communicate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers.[4] REST systems interface with external systems as web resources identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), for example /people/tom, which can be operated upon using standard verbs such as DELETE /people/tom.

In computer programming, create, read, update and delete[1] (as an acronym CRUD) (Sometimes called SCRUD with an "S" for Search) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.[2] Sometimes CRUD is expanded with the words retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete. It is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information; often using computer-based forms and reports. 

REST - there is no connection maintained between the sites.
API allows people to use their info for free.

instead of going into the db, you can hit up the url.

S.N.	Method and Description
1	GET
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

2	HEAD
Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only.

3	POST
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

4	PUT
Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

5	DELETE
Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.

6	CONNECT
Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.

7	OPTIONS
Describe the communication options for the target resource.

8	TRACE
Performs a message loop back test along with the path to the target resource.
