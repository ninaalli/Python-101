Using Git

Git is a collaboration tool that is universally used by programmers
Below are the commands in git we will be using the most:
git init - initialize a connection between that folder and git
git add - show off your updates / differences between the repos
git commit -m "message here" - add a message to this instance
git pull origin branch_name - pull down the updates/changes from a repository
git push origin branch_name - push up your changes to a repository
git checkout -b branch_name - change to a different branch on your local machine, or create a new branch on your local machine
git status - tells you what changes are in this folder and what branch you are on
git clone - makes a copy of a targeted repo in a specified folder of your choice

repos will be done with branches
