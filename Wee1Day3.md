??? methods for how to use the math operations

you cannot iterate over numbers. 

use elif and else under if, otherwise IF will continue to rotate continually.

when there is a new function added in, it will look back up the stack

Python is single threaded and operates on a stack
Recursion can get confusing very quickly . . .

recursion - take your iteration loop. each recursive call is a new call
  the function calls itself again to do the operation to repeat

BaseCase - recursion is always moving toward it. It cleans up the logic; 

once a return runs, none of the code beneath it will hit.

Control + Command + arrow up/down will move a whole line up/down

****it didnt satisfy these two conditions - head and heart. . . so appropriate for today***
