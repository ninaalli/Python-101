Variables are a way to store and save data for use
This is called assignment. You are assigning a value to a variable
Declaring Variables
Do not need to use var
Cannot start with a number
Cannot declare with special characters
Written in snake case

Data Types
Strings
Strings are immutable. Once they are declared they cannot be changed. You can add strings together to create a new string but you cannot mutate an already existing one
  Numbers
    Floats
      decimals
    Integers
      whole number
  Booleans
    0
    False
    
    Supports PEMDAS
==, !=, <=, >=, <, >

if/else statements
  If an expression you passed in is True do something
  Else do something else

Acknowledge:  
You don't need parenthesis
Put a semi colon after the expression you want to evaluate
if to elif to else
Tab to show what part of the function belongs where


IF you wanted to store more data:
  Can be assigned to variables
  Can hold different data types at once
  The values are indexed for us starting at zero  
  
Functions and Statements
We declare our functions with the word def for define
Functions follow the same naming principles as declaring variables
Snake case
Do not start with numbers or special characters
  
LOOPS
One of the core functionalities of programming are loops
Loops are used to run a code block (a piece of code) over and over again until a condition is met
item is a placeholder for the current element in the list. The word item could be any name you want it to be.
Here's one more example using range() method  
  
WHILE LOOP:
Like the For Loop we use this to run a code block over and over again.
The main difference is instead of passing an iterable data structure, we will be running the code block until a condition is no longer true.
