Object Oriented Programming
  Day 1
  
Python is an object oriented language.
It allows us to organize our code for efficiency and readability

Object Oriented Programming is the practice of writing your code around Objects

What are Objects?
Everything in Python is an object
Every object is an instance of a class
We know about the various data types and data structures. Well take lists for example. The moment you create a list you made an instance of it. This list now has access to all the methods inside the list class of Python3
lists belong to a list class
strings belong to a string class
dictionaries belong to a dictionary class

Classes
  A class holds many methods that an object can respond to.
They are defined with the word class
They are always capitalized
They are just blueprints for us to use later

Classes Terminology:
  Instantiate - when we instantiate a class we are creating a new instance of that class.
  Class variable is a variable you want to be given to every instance of the class
  Instance variable is specific to that instance of the class
  *The term self is used over and over again throughout class creation. This is referring to the object in that moment in time. (Instance of the object)

Scope: 
  Scope works inside out
  The methods and variables that are local will have access to those outside of it, however, the outside does not have access to the inside.
  Think about Russian Nesting Dolls
  return is what allows us to move values and variables between two different things

To comment out your code: 
triple quotes doc string used to comment your code and help others read your code 
or #in front of code
